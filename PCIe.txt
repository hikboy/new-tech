xN (x1, x2, x4, x8, x16, x32)

width and frequency are negotiated, during hardware initialization


2.5G bits/s 5GHz 8GHz


hierarchy domian 
    a single end point 
    or a sub-hierarchy containing one or more switches and endpoints

legacy endpoint

low-voltage differential signals

have up to eight logical functions

Each endpoint is assigned a device id, which consist of:
    a bus number
    device number
    function number

Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI)

A PCI or PCI-X function, which may have a configuration space of 256B
A PCIe function has a configuration space extended to 4 KB.  
PCIe configuration space is 256 MB

* architecture

    A PCIe system may be structured into five logical layers,

        configuration/OS layer

        software layer

        transaction layer 

        data link layer

        physical layer
            logical 
            electrical


    The PCIe specification defines the architecture of PCIe devices in terms of three logi-
cal layers, which are the last three layers from those previously listed.

There are four categories of PCIe transactions: memory, I/O, configuration, and message.
The first three categories were also supported by the previous PCI and PCI-X buses.

Message transactions are specific to the PCIe bus.  
Message transactions, also called messages, are used for interrupt signaling, power manage-ment, or error signaling.

On the other hand, in the PCIe architecture there are two types of transactions.
    non-posted transactions
    posted transactions
